This website was for a competition at my high school's club, Future Business Leaders of America, to create a website that had to 
be of a local, made-up business and had to meet certain terms.
It had to be mobile friendly, look and work well, have plenty of business information such as social media, telephone, emails, etc.
My group which consisted of just my partner, Nick, and I had two roles. I was the technical developer and he was the content manager.
We worked together to create an award-winning website in the competition, first place at Regionals and third place at States.
